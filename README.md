BMP-C
=====

BMP library using pure C Language for reading and writing BMP files.

Usually, I use OpenCV to read and write BMP files. However, OpenCV can only write single-channel or 3-channel (with ‘BGR’ channel order) images. In this project, I want to write a programme implementing any-possible-bitdepth read & write.
